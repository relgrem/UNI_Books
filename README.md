# UNI_Books
 Single Balance Data Engine and Winforms UI
UNI-Book is a highly portable, stand-alone user-definable single account accounting/inventory program.  

The simple UI allows for easy entry while keeping a non-editable audtit trail.

Files can be password protected/encrypted.

I plan to make a .net Core lib that can operate off of Azure blob storage for a no DB dependancy data interface.
